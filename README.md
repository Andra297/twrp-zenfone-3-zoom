Zenfone 3 (ZE553KL / Z01HD) Root

I successfully rooted my Zenfone 3. It seemed worth posting since there weren't really any posts I could find verifying a recovery image.

    Unlock the boot loader with the instructions / app from Asus

    Download TWRP. Specifically twrp-3.1.0-0-Z01H-20170408.img **

    Download SuperSU.

    Reboot to fastboot by rebooting the phone, and pressing the down arrow during the unlock screen.

    Flash the recovery image fastboot flash recovery twrp-3.1.0-0-Z01H-20170408.img

    I had to power cycle the phone completely to get TWRP running.

    Reboot to recovery

    Install SuperSU with steps 7 - 10 from the SuperSU site

** I'm generally wary about downloading recovery images from random places, but I found a link posted by shakalaca on the Asus forums (translated), so it seemed worth trying out.
