Zenfone 3 (ZE553KL / Z01HD) Root

I successfully rooted my Zenfone 3. It seemed worth posting since there weren't really any posts I could find verifying a recovery image.

    Unlock the boot loader with the instructions / app from Asus

    Download TWRP. Specifically twrp-3.1.0-0-Z01H-20170408.img **

    Download SuperSU.

    Reboot to fastboot by rebooting the phone, and pressing the down arrow during the unlock screen.

    Flash the recovery image fastboot flash recovery twrp-3.1.0-0-Z01H-20170408.img

    I had to power cycle the phone completely to get TWRP running.

    Reboot to recovery

    Install SuperSU with steps 7 - 10 from the SuperSU site

** I'm generally wary about downloading recovery images from random places, but I found a link posted by shakalaca on the Asus forums (translated), so it seemed worth trying out.

1. Unlock the boot loader with the instructions / app from Asus
2. Download TWRP. Specifically twrp-3.1.0-0-Z01H-20170408.img ** [edit: also rename to twrp.img once downloaded]
3. Download SuperSU.
4. Reboot to fastboot by rebooting the phone, and pressing the down arrow during the unlock screen.
5. Flash the recovery image `fastboot flash recovery twrp.img`
6. I had to power cycle the phone completely to get TWRP running.
7. Reboot to recovery. If TWRP ever asks you something about not making the system read only don't swipe! Say not now.
8. Install SuperSU with steps 7 - 10 from the SuperSU site
